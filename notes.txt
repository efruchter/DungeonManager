Entity

Generating the map is going to be controlled by the package for section generation.
Hero entity's are going to need to do pathfinding, and decision makin.

  Is the entity itself going to make the decisions? Or is there going to be a global manager?
  How many heroes are going to try and storm the castle at a time?
  
  What about the enemy units? Are they going to be more intelligent as well?
  
  I think the entities themselves need to decide what to do, based on what they have seen, and what
  is available to them, and what is visible.
